Hey, I'm Onur! Thank you for visiting my blog. Bear with me while I'm introducing myself a little bit.

I've been living in Japan for some time now. I'm currently working as a Machine Learning engineer in Tokyo. 
I pass the time eating food, playing games, learning Japanese endlessly.

This blog will be mainly about topics in Computer Vision and Software Engineering! 
I'm planning to share interesting stuff while learning it myself.

Looking forward to hearing from you, so please feel free to comment and share your opinions!
